# Portfolio Website - Aryan Kumar Singh

## About Me

Hey there! I'm Aryan, a final-year BTech CSE student at VIT Vellore who believes data tells better stories than most people do—you just need to know how to listen. 

I'm passionate about turning messy data into meaningful insights and building solutions that make both users and dashboards happy. When I'm not debugging code or talking to my terminal, I'm probably overthinking variable names or wondering why my code works after I remove a semicolon.

## About This Website

This portfolio is my digital home on the internet—a place where I showcase my work, skills, and the occasional successful project that didn't crash during demo day.

**Built with:**
- **React** - Because who doesn't love components?
- **Vite** - For that lightning-fast dev experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Making CSS fun again (yes, it's possible)
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations that don't make users dizzy

### Features

- **Dark/Light Mode** - Because your eyes matter (top-right corner, you're welcome)
- **Fully Responsive** - Looks good on everything from your phone to your grandma's tablet
- **Three-Segment Layout** - Desktop gets the full treatment with sidebar, main content, and button bar
- **Scroll to Top Button** - Saves you from developing RSI from scrolling up
- **Contact Info** - Centered and pristine, just like my code (mostly)
- **Smooth Animations** - Powered by Framer Motion, making everything look fancy

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
```

**Skills I Use:**
